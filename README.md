# CaraLisp
A study in functional programming.

This Work in progress for yet another lisp implemented in golang. 
The goal here is that it's a personal method for learning about proper functional ideas and concepts.

The interpreter, when done, will most likely not be the most efficient, but will sport some ideas grabbed from various functional programming papers and languages.

I intend to borrow from concepts found in:
- General lambda calculus.
- [McCarthy's paper](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf)
- Haskell (because Haskell is beautiful)
